This module tries to compile itself with "-lmpi", some systems require
additional compiler flags when building and linking MPI applications.

If `make && make test` doesn't work, try specifying CCFLAGS and
LDFLAGS and LIBS correctly and re-run Makefile.PL.

Some systems might be a lot happier with the module if you build a static
perl, instead of one which dynamically loads the C portion of this module.
You will also need to statically link the Storable module.  See the
ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage for more details.
